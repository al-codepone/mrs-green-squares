# Mrs. Green Squares

Mrs. Green Squares is a clone of the GitHub contribution graph that has green squares.
Except it visualizes local repositories on your computer instead of your repos on GitHub.
And it will display the full timeline instead of just a single year.

It is a Node.js script and when you run the script it will output a static index.html
that contains the visualization.

The first version is still in development and this README is incomplete.
